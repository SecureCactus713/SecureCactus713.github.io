            <h1>Network Security Objective 4</h1>
            <p>
              Create a policy or procedure that addresses events such as:<br><br>
              a disaster recovery plan, a business continuity plan,<br><br>
              an incident response policy, an acceptable usage document,<br><br>
              an information security policy, a physical security policy,<br><br>
              assessments or troubleshooting procedures.<br><br>

            <h2>Objective Application</h2>
            <p>
              For this objective, I had two assignments from my <b><i>NTS405 Incident Response</i></b><br>
              class and my <b><i>NTW275 Network Infrastructure Design</i></b> class that best displayed<br>
              my mastery of this objective.<br>
            </p>
            <p>
              In my <b><i>NTS405 Incident Response</i></b> class I was introduced to the steps necessary<br>
              to be well prepared as a member of an incident response team. I was taught what<br>
              role I may play in an emergency and how best to be a reliable asset for other<br>
              members of the incident response team. I was able to display what I learned<br>
              in this class with my Final Assignment.<br>
            </p>

          <div class="mainbar">
            <p>
              For this Final my tasked was to write up a comprehensive Incident Response plan<br>
              on how I would war game an incident. I was to include any given disaster scenario,<br>
              the potential events that could occur this event, and how I would respond in this<br>
              scenario as a member of a incident response team.<br>
            </p>

          <div class="midbar">
            <p>
              And in <b><i>NTW275 Network Infrastructure Design</i></b> I learned how to translate organizational<br>
              needs into network designs. This included security considerations for the logic of<br>
              both the physical network topology and the server infrastructure in the design process.<br>
              My Final Assignment was a good showcase of what I learned in the class.<br>
            </p>

            <p>
              This Final had me conducting a Risk Assessment for a fictional company's office network,<br>
              then provide a recommendation in the way of a network configuration that could potentially<br>
              mitigate the risks that I had identified in my assessment.<br><br>
              I feel confident that I met this objective with the presentation of my incident response and risk<br>
              assessment documentation where both had the utmost adherence to industry standards and regulations.<br>
