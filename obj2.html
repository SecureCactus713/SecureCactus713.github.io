            <h2>Objective Application</h2>
            <p>
              I was able to meet this objective over the course<br>
              of my <b><i>NTS330 Applied Exploits and Hacking</i></b> class.<br>
              I completed three assignments that operated under<br>
              a continuing scenario as a contracted Penetration<br>
              tester as well as my Final Assignment for the class.<br>
            </p>
            <p>
              The scenario for three of the assignments was that<br>
              I was a hired as a contract Penetration tester.<br>
              In each of the assignments I was tasked with proving<br>
              my PEN testing knowledge by completing a task.<br>
            </p>
            <div class="img-container">

            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="mainbar">
            <p>
              The first assignment had me setting up a pentest platform and documenting<br>
              my process every step of the way. I was also tasked with answering several<br>
              questions to prove that my test platform was functional.<br><br>
              The second assignment was to gather information on an organization and<br>
              to document my findings. I was to not do any direct scanning but use<br>
              other progams as a means of data gathering on my chosen target.<br><br>
              The third assignment was to perform network sniffing of a closed network<br>
              and document my process and findings. I was also tasked with performing<br>
              packet capture analysis of a selected malware and documenting those findings.<br>

              The final assignment was to take the penetration<br>
              testing skills that I had learned during this course<br>
              and to apply them in a practical and legal manner.<br>
            </p>

            <p>
              In this assignment I was to successfully join and gain entry to the website<br>
              Hack The Box. The only way to gain entry to this site was with procuring an<br>
              invite code by attempting to hack the webpage.<br><br>
              This required analyzing the source code of the landing page for the site<br>
              and following the clues that were left. Some of these clues required<br>
              inspecting code with a debugger, decryipting serval types of encryptions,<br>
              and applying critical thinking and problem solving skills learned in this class.<br><br>
              I feel that with these four projects, I have covered this objective extensively<br>
              while providing step by step instructions on my process as well as demonstrating<br>
              breaking into a network using various software.<br>
