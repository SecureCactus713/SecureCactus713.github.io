	    <h2>Objective Application</h2>
	    <br><br><br><br>
	    <p>
		    I was able to meet this objective over the course<br>
		    of my <b><i>NTS330 Applied Exploits and Hacking</i></b> class.<br>
		    I completed three assignments that operated under<br>
		    a continuing scenario as a contracted Penetration<br>
		    tester as well as my Final Assignment for the class.<br>
	    </p>
	    <br><br>
	    <p>
		    The scenario for three of the assignments was that<br>
		    I was a hired as a contract Penetration tester.<br>
		    In each of the assignments I was tasked with proving<br>
		    my PEN testing knowledge by completing a task.<br>
	    </p>

    </div>
    <br><br><br><br><br><br>
    <p>
	    The first assignment had me setting up a pentest platform and documenting<br>
	    my process every step of the way. I was also tasked with answering several<br>
	    questions to prove that my test platform was functional.<br><br>
	    The second assignment was to gather information on an organization and<br>
	    to document my findings. I was to not do any direct scanning but use<br>
	    other progams as a means of data gathering on my chosen target.<br><br>
	    The third assignment was to perform network sniffing of a closed network<br>
	    and document my process and findings. I was also tasked with performing<br>
	    packet capture analysis of a selected malware and documenting those findings.<br>

		    The final assignment was to take the penetration<br>
		    testing skills that I had learned during this course<br>
		    and to apply them in a practical and legal manner.<br>

    <p>
	    In this assignment I was to successfully join and gain entry to the website<br>
	    Hack The Box. The only way to gain entry to this site was with procuring an<br>
	    invite code by attempting to hack the webpage.<br><br>
	    This required analyzing the source code of the landing page for the site<br>
	    and following the clues that were left. Some of these clues required<br>
	    inspecting code with a debugger, decryipting serval types of encryptions,<br>
	    and applying critical thinking and problem solving skills learned in this class.<br>
