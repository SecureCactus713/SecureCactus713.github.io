    <h1>Network Security</h1>
    <br><br><br><br><br><br>
    <p>A network security specialist is a professional who focuses on ensuring information confidentiality, integrity and availability.<br>
        Network security utilizes proactive techniques, including defense-in-depth and layered security, to mitigate or eliminate<br>
        vulnerabilities in information systems and to protect against potential exploitation. This may include network and application<br>
        penetration testing, software and hardware reverse engineering as well as developing exploits for identified vulnerabilities.<br>
        Security professionals possess intimate knowledge of critical business components. The Network Security degree reflects the<br>
        application of theory and is aligned with industry standards and guidelines. It provides students with the opportunity to<br>
        synthesize and apply the vital skills and knowledge necessary to succeed in the cyber security workforce.
