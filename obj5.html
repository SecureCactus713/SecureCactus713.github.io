              Develop a research report or implementation plan concerning<br><br>
              legal and ethical best practices and mandated requirements<br><br>

            <h2>Objective Application</h2>
            <p>
              With this particular objective, I had two assignments from my<br>
              <b><i>NTS435 International and Federal INFOSEC Standards and Regulations</i></b><br>
              class and my <b><i>TCH310 Technology, Society and Ethics</i></b> class that best<br>
              displayed my mastery of this objective.<br>
            </p>
            <p>
              From my <b><i>NTS435 International and Federal INFOSEC Standards and Regulations</i></b><br>
              class I had an assignment to select a Security Framework from a provided list and<br>
              write a detailed research paper about the framework.<br>
            </p>
            <img src="/image/NTS435-Assignment-Security_Frameworks.png" class="obj" alt="Security_Frameworks">
          </div>
          <div class="mainbar">
            <p> 
              For this research paper the Security Framework I chose was FISMA,<br>
              The Federal Information Security Modernization Act of 2014. I provided<br>
              an indepth look at this framework, going into the background of the framework<br>
              with it's purpose and scope, looking at the controls and sub-controls, and<br>
              explaining the authorization and accreditation process for this framework.<br><br>
              With this research paper I covered the legal aspects of the objective with this government<br>
              regulation for the implementation of policies and best practices for information systems.<br>
            </p>

            <p>
              But because the very nature of our industry reaches beyond government regulation or<br>
              business operations, it often bleeds into the fabric of our society. The FISMA framework<br>
              was put in place to help protect the the general public. And while the government<br>
              recommends that businesses use this framework in their operations, not all adopt it<br>
              and this often leads to highly questionable ethical business practices, as best shown<br>
              in my assignment from my <b><i>TCH310 Technology, Society and Ethics</i></b> class.<br>
            </p>
            <p>
              In <b><i>TCH310 Technology, Society and Ethics</i></b> we studied essential concepts<br>
              necessary to evaluate the social and ethical impacts of the design,<br>
              creation and use of new technologies. This required us to carfully study<br>
              and evaluate dilemmas and scenarios that highlighted how technology<br>
              challenges social and moral principles in the modern day. One such<br>
              scenario was to identify ethical issues related to any technology.<br>
            </p>
            <img src="/image/TCH310-Discussion-Ethics_and_Emerging_Technologies.png" class="obj" alt="Ethics_and_Emerging_Tec">

          <div class="mainbar">
            <p>
              In this assignment I was to pick a technology topic from a provided<br>
              list and identify three ethical issues related to that topic, present<br>
              them in a Powerpoint presentation and discuss this with my peers.<br>
              I chose video gaming as my topic and discussed some of the questionable<br>
              practices that were taking place. Of these issues I spoke about unethical<br>
              gambling mechanics with loot boxes targeting children, the toxic and<br>
              unsustainable work culture of crunch placed on developers, and the pushing<br>
              of mature content to young audiences.<br><br>
              Researching and discussing the ethics of this portion of the technology<br>
              industry helped me to understand this objective and identify the importance<br>
              of the ethical requirements that guide information security.<br>
